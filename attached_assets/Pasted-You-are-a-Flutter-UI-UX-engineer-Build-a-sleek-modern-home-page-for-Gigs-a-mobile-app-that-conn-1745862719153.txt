You are a Flutter UI/UX engineer. Build a sleek, modern home page for “Gigs,” a mobile app that connects people who need one-time errands done with vetted runners. The home page should:

1. *Hero & Search*  
   - Full-width greeting banner showing user’s name and location (“Good afternoon, Sherif — Cairo”).  
   - Prominent search bar with placeholder “Search tasks near you…”.  
   - Filter icon on the right for quick access to category, distance, urgency filters.

2. *Category Carousel*  
   - Horizontally scrollable chips or icons for popular categories (e.g. Moving, Cleaning, Grocery, Custom).  
   - “+ Custom” chip at the end to let users define a new category.

3. *Map Preview*  
   - Interactive map snapshot (or placeholder) showing pins for nearby tasks.  
   - Tappable overlay that expands to full-screen map view.

4. *Task List*  
   - Vertical list of task cards below the map:  
     - Each card shows task title, brief description, distance, pay, and urgency badge if applicable.  
     - Small runner avatar or icon of the category.  
     - Soft shadows, 2xl rounded corners, and a consistent card height.

5. *Call to Action*  
   - Floating action button (FAB) at bottom right with “+ Post a Task” icon.  
   - Button style: primary accent color, slight drop shadow, subtle scale-on-press animation.

6. *Bottom Navigation Bar*  
   - Five tabs: Home (active), Browse, Messages, Post Task, Profile.  
   - Use Material icons and clear labels.

7. *Styling & Animation*  
   - Use a light theme with a white background, primary color (#4A76A8) for accents, and neutral grays for text.  
   - Lato or Roboto font, medium weight for headings, regular for body text.  
   - Micro-interactions: fade-in cards on scroll, ripple effect on taps.

Generate Flutter code (stateless widgets) with appropriate layouts (Column, Row, Stack, ListView, BottomNavigationBar), custom components for TaskCard and CategoryChip, and placeholder data. Ensure all paddings, margins, and typography follow a cohesive, modern design system.
